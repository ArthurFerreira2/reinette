A french Apple 1 emulator

Implements a 6502 emulator, basic I/O and runs the Woz monitor.

Can aslo run Vince Briel's [Replica 1](http://www.brielcomputers.com/wordpress/?cat=17) ROM which includes [Krusader](http://school.anhb.uwa.edu.au/personalpages/kwessen/apple1/Krusader.htm) and Apple 1 Basic. 
Just convert the binary dump into a C array as it has been done with Apple 1 ROM in woz.h

Passes the [Klaus Test Suite](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests)

Have fun !
