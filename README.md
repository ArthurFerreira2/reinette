The french Apple 1 emulator

Implements a 6502 emulator, basic I/O and runs the Woz monitor.

Can aslo run Vince Briel's Replica 1 ROM which includes Krusader and Apple 1 Basic. 
Just convert the binary dump into a C array as it has been done with Apple 1 ROM in woz.h

Passes the Klaus Test Suite (https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests)

Have fun !
